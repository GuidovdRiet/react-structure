# Global use for React components

The goal for this project is to create a React setup where components which are used more than once are structured in the following way.

```javascript
// Components
import Layout from "./Layout";
import Card from "./Card";
import Text from "./Text";
import Button from "./Button";

const Structure = () => {
  return (
    <Layout __type="container">
      <Card __type="primary">
        <Text __type="h1" primary>
          Global use for React components
        </Text>
        <Button __type="default">Next â†’</Button>
      </Card>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Structure;
```

## How to structure your code this way?

Is this example I created a component with the name `Card`. This component will receive a property with the name `__type`. This `__type` selects the right component in the `cards object` and returns the associated `Card` component for this type.

```javascript
// Cards
import DefaultCard from "./DefaultCard";
import SecondaryCard from "./SecondaryCard";
import UserCard from "./UserCard";

const cards = {
  default: DefaultCard,
  secondary: SecondaryCard,
  user: UserCard
};

const Card = ({ __type, ...props }) => {
  const Comp = cards[__type];
  if (typeof cards[__type] === "undefined") {
    return null;
  }
  return Comp && <Comp {...props} />;
};

export default Card;
```

## What did I accomplish by using this setup?

[setup]: /img/Start.jpg "Setup style"

* Every project uses the same code structure. This way every developer in the team knows about what type of component you are talking about during a conversation. 
* New members of the team can easily understand the code structure of the project.
* Visually you will understand the code in a component faster because the logic for every group of components is nested one level deeper in your application (check the above image).
